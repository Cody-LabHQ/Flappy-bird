# Flappy Bird

A high-fidelity reconstruction of the classic Flappy Bird game, engineered entirely in vanilla JavaScript. This project demonstrates advanced usage of the HTML5 Canvas API and Web Audio API to create a complete game experience without the need for external image assets or sound files.

## 🧠 About The Code

This project is structured as a modular, object-oriented application. Unlike simple script-kiddy clones, this codebase separates concerns into logical units to ensure maintainability and performance.

### Key Features
*   **Procedural Graphics**: Every visual element—from the bird and pipes to the parallax city background and clouds—is drawn in real-time using the Canvas 2D Context. No image files (`.png`, `.jpg`) are required.
*   **Synthesized Audio**: The `SoundManager` class (`js/audio.js`) utilizes the Web Audio API to generate sound waves (Sine, Square, Sawtooth) on the fly. This means instant load times and zero dependency on `.mp3` or `.wav` files.
*   **Responsive Engine**: The game logic uses a reference height (`LOGICAL_HEIGHT`) and calculates a scale factor. This allows the game to run full-screen on any device (Desktop, Tablet, Mobile) while maintaining consistent physics and gameplay mechanics.
*   **Particle System**: A lightweight particle engine handles visual effects like feathers falling when flapping or dust clouds upon collision.
*   **Persistence**: High scores are saved locally using the browser's `localStorage`.

### Architecture
*   `index.html`: Entry point, sets up the canvas and imports modules.
*   `css/style.css`: Handles full-screen layout and prevents mobile scrolling behaviors.
*   `js/game.js`: The central game loop, state management, and input handling.
*   `js/entities.js`: Contains logic for the Bird, Pipes, Backgrounds, and Particles.
*   `js/audio.js`: Handles real-time audio synthesis.
*   `js/utils.js`: Helper functions for math and collision detection.
